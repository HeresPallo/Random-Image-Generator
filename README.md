A Capstone project for Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp, we were expected to build a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, that integrates a chosen public API from the given list: Public API Lists. The website should interact with the chosen API, retrieve data, and present it in a user-friendly manner.

Objectives:
1. Develop an understanding of how to integrate public APIs into web projects.

2. Gain practical experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.

3. Enhance understanding of client-server communication using Axios.

4. Demonstrate ability to manipulate, present, and work with data retrieved from APIs.
